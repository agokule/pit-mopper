# Minesweeper in Python

I have recreated the game "Mineseweeper" in python.

## Keyboard Shorcuts

1. Ctrl + I - Shows the Version of Minesweeper
2. Ctrl + U - Checks for updates
3. Ctrl + Q - Quits Minesweeper, same as just closing the game loader
4. Ctrl + O - Loads a game from a minesweeper game file
5. Ctrl + A - Enables/Disables Chording
6. Ctrl + D - Enables/Disables Dark Mode
7. Ctrl + S - Saves the current game, only applicable when a game is being played
8. Space - Does the same thing that the "Play!" button in the game loader does

## Latest Features in v1.2.0

1. Added a custom grid size so that you can play on any grid you want! As long as it is between 6x6 and 75x75
2. 2 new commands have been added to the Settings menu: Dark Mode and Version Info. Both of them are self-explanatory as to what they do
3. As mentioned above a new Dark Mode has been added
4. Now it tells you the size of your game before you play it
5. It now tells you how many mines there are and how many flags you have put down without having to go to the Additional Info page, also shows percent complete
6. A License has been added to the installer
7. Keyboard shortcuts have been added to the game, you can find a list of them below, you can also find most of them next to the options in the Settings and File menus
