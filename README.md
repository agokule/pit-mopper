# Minesweeper in Python

I have recreated the game "Mineseweeper" in python.

Project Structure:
- ./code - Actual source code for Minesweeper
- ./code/data - Data files for Minesweeper(ie: Images and Fonts)
- ./code/multiplayer - Soon going to files for Minesweeper multiplayer
- ./images - Images used for documentation

## Keyboard Shorcuts

1. Ctrl + I - Shows the Version of Minesweeper
2. Ctrl + U - Checks for updates
3. Ctrl + Q - Quits Minesweeper, same as just closing the game loader
4. Ctrl + O - Loads a game from a minesweeper game file
5. Ctrl + A - Enables/Disables Chording
6. Ctrl + D - Enables/Disables Dark Mode
7. Ctrl + S - Saves the current game, only applicable when a game is being played
8. Space - Does the same thing that the "Play!" button in the game loader does
7. Alt + Q - Closes the game, same as clicking the X
9. Alt + I - Gives extra information about the current game, same as going to File > More Info
10. Ctrl + H - Shows your highscores

## Latest Features in v1.3.0

1. You can now choose how many mines are in the game!
2. Dark mode has been updated so that everything is actually dark
3. The new updater is now a separate program that first uninstalls the game then installs the latest version
4. You can no longer die on the first click! I wonder how that was an issue for so long...
5. Performance has been improved
6. You can now see your high scores
7. 3 new keyboard shortcuts have been added including Alt + Q to quit game, Alt + I to show more info about game, and Ctrl + H to show high scores
